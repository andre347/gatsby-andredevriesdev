### Tableau & Alteryx

Hi! I am Andre ðŸ‘‹ and I am a Tableau & Alteryx trainer and consultant. I currently work for [The Information Lab](https://theinformationlab.co.uk) in London. My main role there is to help people see and understand their data by using these two industry leading data analytics tools. In the last few years I've been focussing more and more on building and delivering educational content around data & data visualisation. I am also involved with our [Dataschool](http://www.thedataschool.co.uk) - this is a 2-year program focussed on creating the next batch of great data analysts. At the Dataschool I teach various topics, ranging from 'Working with APIs' to 'Introduction to Regular Expressions'.

### Web Development

I am also very much a self-taught developer. Although I don't really like to use the word 'developer'. To me this sounds a bit like I'm stuck in a basement coding all day ðŸ¤“. That's not really what I do. I mainly use web technologies to help others be successful with Tableau & Alteryx. Early on in my career I focussed on Python but in the last few years I primarly code in JavaScript. If you want to get a sense of what I create, then head over to my [Github](https://www.github.com/andre347).

### Hobbies

If I'm not deep down into data or web development I spend my time running, in the gym or I'm involved with my biggest hobby: football.
