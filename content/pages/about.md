### Tableau & Alteryx

Hi! I am Andre ðŸ‘‹ and I am a Tableau & Alteryx trainer and consultant. I currently work for [The Information Lab](https://theinformationlab.co.uk) in London. My main role there is to help people see and understand their data by using these two industry leading data analytics tools. In the last few years I've been focussing more and more on building and delivering educational content around data & data visualisation. I am also involved with our [Dataschool](http://www.thedataschool.co.uk) - this is a 2-year program focussed on creating the next batch of great data analysts. At the Dataschool I teach various topics, ranging from 'Working with APIs' to 'Introduction to Regular Expressions'.

### Web Development

I also regularly blog and work on web development and creative coding projects. This is often in relation to Tableau and Alteryx. Although I don't really like to use the word 'developer'. To me this sounds a bit like I'm stuck in a basement coding all day ðŸ¤“. That's not really what I do. I mainly use web technologies to help others be successful with Tableau & Alteryx. My front-end frameworks of choice are Vue.js & React and I'm also using D3.js if I feel up for it. Early on in my career I focussed on Python but in the last few years I primarly code in JavaScript. If you want to get a sense of what I create, then head over to my [Github page](https://www.github.com/andre347).

### Teaching

I have designed and delivered a whole host of training sessions in more than 10 countries. The training content ranges from introducing Tableau & Alteryx to specific topics such as using APIs and web development related topics.
